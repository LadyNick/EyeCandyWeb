        <p> In Eye Candy Bakery, the player takes the role of a character who is in need
            of a job, either for the newest tech, or to prevent being kicked out. (That
            part was never decided) The player goes and explores outdoors in search for
            employment with minimum requirements and demand. Eventually the player stops
            at a bakery that is hiring urgently, entering and meeting Candy and Coco.</p>

        <img src="candyrefcrop.png" >
        <p> Candy is the head baker and owner of the Eye Candy Bakery. She is imaginative,
            energetic, and silly. She aims to be unique with anything she creates and 
            finds everything she sees to be fascinating. As an experimentalist she values
            people with an eye for creativity. She is looking to hire someone to help her
            with a big project.

        <p> Coco is Candy's assistant baker and best and most loyal friend. Coco is more 
            calm and collected than Candy, but isn't weak by any means. She prides herself 
            on keeping the bakery clean and is meticulous when working with her hands. Coco
            previously worked as a nurse but quit due to lack of sleep, and decided to 
            work with her best friend, making and decorating cute sweets everyday.

        <img src="insidebakery.png" >
        <p> When the player asks about work, Candy and Coco explain the simplicity of the position
            and hire the player. For the player's training, the player must make a cake, with
            Candy and Coco as guides. The player will follow instructions using the ingredients:
            flour, eggs, milk, sugar, butter, flavoring, frosting, and extras
            for decorating.
