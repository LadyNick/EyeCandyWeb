    <p style="font-size:90px; text-align:center; margin-bottom:20px">What happened
        while taking CS179N at UCR?
    </p>


    <div class="boxsection" style="width:90%; overflow:auto;">
        
        <p> For CS179N at UCR, we were instructed to split the plans for our game 
            into 100 points with different priority levels. We had 7 puzzles,
            each with 10 points, totaling 70 points. The remaining 30 points accounted for the introduction,
            the dialogue, characters, settings, and things of that matter. Each team member would
            be working on something every week, and something or even multiple things
            were supposed to be getting done every week. Unfortunately that wasn't
            always the case in my group, and I completed did points of the game. For
            others, it was taking 6 or 7 weeks to have a total of 10 points completed,
            and even then there was a lack of effort in some areas or it looked unfinished.
            For the last 3 weeks, for everyone to get up to 20 points, because each member
            was supposed to do 20 points each, the remaining work was rushed, and not up to par.
            I ended up completing a third of the game. There were multiple points that were
            awarded to a member as complete, even though they weren't, or we're completed by another 
            member.

            release or present anything unless I am very happy

            and then rebuild most of the game, adding changes where I see needed. I plan to release
            Eye Candy Bakery solo on steam before the Spring Season of 2024.

        What are the planned changes?
    </p>

    <div id="box" class="boxsection pink">
        <div class="imgheading">

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <img style="width:84px; height:108px" src="player.png">
        <img style="width:84px; height:108px" src="combotest.png">
        <img style="width:84px; height:108px" src="coco.png">
        </div>

        <p> For the introduction, for the most part everything is to my liking because I made all 
            the sprites animations. I originally created a customizable player and name menu accounting for hair, skin, and shirt(eye) colors,
            but I have decided that I would like to add an actual eye customizable color. Originally 
            the player had black eyes by default but I'm going to change it so the eyes can look like
            Candy's and Coco's. This means I will be creating more sprites and more animations. 
        </p>
    </div>

            <h1>Setting</h1>
            <img src="Alpha/bakeryfix1.png">

        </div>

        <p> The acutal outdoors art and characters are to my liking since I did it myself 
            during the course. However, when the player goes into the bakery, it simply goes to the bakery
            background with the two larger Candy and Coco sprites present. I want to add a room area 
            for the player to be able to walk around inside of the bakery, going to certain spots to do 
            different steps of the baking process. I think this makes things a little more fun and gives
            better opportunities for placing easter eggs. 
            
        </p>

            <h1>Dialogue</h1>
            <img src="Alpha/dialoguefix1.png">

        </div>

        <p>
            The only dialogue I wrote was for the outdoors area and I put someone else on the task of
            writing and doing the dialogue for indoors and everywhere else, but I am unhappy with 
            the result. I provided the font and the color of the box to be used for the dialogue but: 
            1. The dialogue box is black, 2. The font sizes are off, 3. The space between each line is
            too large, 4. The typewriter effect is missing, and 5. I don't really like the dialogue. 
            So, I will be changing these things. I also drew all the sprites for the dialogue, 
            including alternate poses and facial pieces for alternate expressions, but they weren't used,
            or weren't used the way I imagined. I will also make these changes. I also want to add 
            vocals for the characters, but with sounds not actual voices.

        </div>

        <p>
            The rush hour puzzle funtions, but there are improvements that I want to make. 1. The grid is very obvious, I think 
            it should be of lower opacity or be removed completely, 2. The colors and sprites don't fit in with the rest of the 
            game in terms of aesthetic, (This takes palce inside a bakery and the player is suddenly met with 
            boxes) so I will redesign them and the background, and 3. I want to remove the limitation of 
            moves. I plan to scrap this minigame and to redo it from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though the catching game is the easiest of them all to create, it still took the 
            person in charge 7 weeks to complete and test, and the quality still wasn't great.
            I made a lot of sprites to allow the player to customize their character to look the way
            they choose throughout the game. But, the person in charge of this minigame said 
            implementing it was "too much," when I provided everything to make it possible. So the
            things that need to change here are 1. Including the customization made by the player on 
            the main character, 2. Changing the background, which was one I provided but was not supposed
            to be used for this purpose, and 3. Changing everything to fit the aeshtetic of the game and
            to complement with my vision. I plan to scrap this minigame altogether and to redo it
            from scratch.

        <p> The pipe puzzle works, but there are improvements I would like to make. 1. Once again, the grid is 
            very present, so I think it can be reduced or removed completely, 2. The colors and sprites
            once again don't fit with the aesthetic of the game and my vision for it, so I will redesign
            the sprites and add a new background, 3. I don't think there needs to be as many pieces as
            there are on the board, and I want to make the connections make more sense. I plan to
            scrap this minigame altogether and to redo it from scratch.

        <p> Even though it functions, this wordsearch puzzle doesn't fit with the rest of the game. 1. The letters don't match the font I
            provided, 2. The background is a singular color, and is too saturated, 3. I might change 
            the game for this ingredient simply because I can't think of a way to fit a wordsearch 
            into the game although it originally didn't matter as much. I plan to scrap this minigame
            altogether and to redo it from scratch.

            I was in charge of creating these puzzles and I am happy with the results because I know
            I could create what I imagined. However, I do want to add original music to this and all 
            other minigames that I plan to commission from musicians on Fiverr. I also plan on adding 
            sound effects to every minigame, which wasn't previously added.

        <p>
            Originally this simon says game was known to be representing flavoring an icing parts
            of making a cake, but when I think about it more, it doesn't fit very well into the
            full game. 1. I think the art is super cool but it doesn't fit the pastel color palette
            of the game, 2. In this minigame the player is opening a locked box to get the ingredient
            to be used, but I don't remember seeing an explanation for why its locked up in the 
            dialogue in the first place. I think I'm going to scrap and redesign the game for this 
            ingredient, changing it to frosting, and changing it to a connect the dots kind of game with some 
            obstacles between the paths.

            This game for this step is supposed to be  series of mazes, but they are all very very
            basic in terms of design, sprites, and colors. 1. I will have to redesign the mazes, perhaps
            even change it into a running game with 3 lanes, 2. Change the colors, and 3. Add various
            sprites.

        </div>

        <p> The ending was never dealt with by anyone in the team including myself, so I will 
            implement it myself. I will also add end credits and elements of that sort. There 
            was supposed to be a saving system. I created a continue button in the main menu,
            but it does't currently serve any function and there is no way to make a save or any
            automatic saving.
